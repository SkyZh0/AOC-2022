or an already-fallen rock, the falling rock stops where it is (having landed on something) and a new rock immediately begins falling.

Drawing falling rocks with @ and stopped rocks with #, the jet pattern in the example above manifests as follows:

The first rock begins falling:

Jet of gas pushes rock right:

To prove to the elephants your simulation is accurate, they want to know how tall the tower will get after 2022 rocks have stopped (but before the 2023rd rock begins falling). In this example, the tower of rocks will be 3068 units tall.

How many units tall will the tower of rocks be after 2022 rocks have stopped falling?
